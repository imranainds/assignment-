Q1. Create a function which will take a list as an argument and return the product of all the numbers
after creating a flat list.
Use the below-given list as an argument for your function.
list1 = [1,2,3,4, [44,55,66, True], False, (34,56,78,89,34), {1,2,3,3,2,1}, {1:34, "key2": [55, 67, 78, 89], 4: (45,
22, 61, 34)}, [56, 'data science'], 'Machine Learning']
Note: you must extract numeric keys and values of the dictionary also.
ANSWER 
def product_of_numbers(list1):
  """

Q2. Write a python program for encrypting a message sent to you by your friend. The logic of encryption
should be such that, for a the output should be z. For b, the output should be y. For c, the output should
be x respectively. Also, the whitespace should be replaced with a dollar sign. Keep the punctuation
marks unchanged.
Input Sentence: I want to become a Data Scientist.
Encrypt the above input sentence using the program you just created.
Note: Convert the given input sentence into lowercase before encrypting. The final output should be
lowercase.
 ANSWER -
def encrypt_message(message):
  """
  This function encrypts a message by replacing all the lowercase letters with the letters
  that are three letters behind them in the alphabet, and replacing all the whitespace with
  a dollar sign.

  Args:
    message: The message to be encrypted.

  Returns:
    The encrypted message.
  """

  encrypted_message = ""
  for letter in message.lower():
    if letter == " ":
      encrypted_message += "$"
    else:
      encrypted_message += chr(ord(letter) + 3)

  return encrypted_message


if __name__ == "__main__":
  message = "I want to become a Data Scientist."
  encrypted_message = encrypt_message(message)
  print("The encrypted message is:", encrypted_message)
