    "‚ù§Ô∏è Improved performance: Multithreading can lead to significant performance improvements, especially in tasks that involve I/O operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ù§Ô∏è Resource sharing: Threads within the same process share the same memory space, making it easier to share data between threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ù§Ô∏è Responsiveness: Multithreading can help in keeping a program responsive to user interactions, even when some threads are blocked.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ù§Ô∏è Simplified code: Certain tasks can be expressed more simply when decomposed into threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "üíî Complexity: Multithreading can make the program more complex and harder to debug due to shared data and potential race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "üíî Synchronization issues: Managing access to shared resources among threads can lead to synchronization problems like race conditions and deadlocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "üíî Potential for bugs: Multithreading can introduce hard-to-reproduce bugs, such as race conditions, that are difficult to detect and fix.\n",
    "\n",

    "A deadlock occurs in a multithreaded program when two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting for the other to release a resource. In other words, a set of processes are deadlocked if each process is waiting for an event that only another process in the set can cause. Deadlocks can happen due to improper synchronization and can be challenging to detect and resolve.\n",

    "Race Condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "A race condition occurs when two or more threads access shared data and try to change it at the same time. The final outcome (and the program's behavior) depends on the order of execution of the threads. Race conditions can lead to unpredictable behavior and data corruption. They are typically resolved using synchronization techniques like locks to ensure that only one thread can access the shared data at any given time.\n",
